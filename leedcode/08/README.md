# Function input and Output	 : Allow One Function Call

建立一個closure, 並確保傳入的函式只會被調用一次

- The first time the returned function is called, it should return the same result as fn.

- Every subsequent time it is called, it should return undefined.

```javascript
var once = function(fn) {
    //完成此處
};
```
